Arduino Leonardo Keyboard Emulator for Dragon 32 Keyboard to be used as a RetroPie keyboard

This sketch allows you to use the Dragon 32/64 Keyboard as a USB emulator for a Raspberry Pi build.

The sketch uses the Break key to access special characters (see keyboard layout image)

Will add more details soon.
